📌 Project Description

This project is a modern React + Vite application named Gemini, built with a clean and scalable architecture.
The project follows a well-organized folder structure containing separate modules for components, configuration files, and assets.
It includes a dedicated Sidebar layout, Main UI components, and a configurable gemini.js file inside the config folder, making the application flexible for dashboard-style or AI-based interfaces.

This project highlights best practices in component-based UI development, efficient file structuring, and fast build performance with Vite. It is ideal as a frontend portfolio project demonstrating layout management, component reusability, and modular React development.
